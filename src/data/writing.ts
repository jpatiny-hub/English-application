    model: `Dear Ms Tremblay,

Thank you for your interest in working with us. Ahead of our call next Tuesday, I would like to give you a brief overview of our company.

Northbridge Biologics was founded in 2004 and has since grown into a team of about 450 people. We develop and produce enzymes and diagnostic kits for the pharmaceutical and food sectors. Our company is organized into five departments, and each department is responsible for its own budget. There is close collaboration between R&D and production, which allows us to scale up new products quickly.

Our clients include hospitals, universities and several large vaccine manufacturers in Europe and North America. We prioritize quality and transparency, and our teams are highly skilled in fermentation and purification.

What sets us apart from our competitors is our flexibility: we can adapt our processes to very specific client requirements.

I look forward to discussing possible collaborations with you.

Kind regards,
[Your name]`,

Scientists will be spending most of their time designing new molecules and analysing data rather than pipetting.

The company is likely to be smaller in terms of staff but much larger in terms of output. Our production sites might be located closer to patients, as small, modular bioreactors will have replaced the huge tanks we use today. Many employees will be working remotely, and meetings will probably take place in virtual reality.

However, some things will not have changed. Quality and patient safety will still be our top priorities, and human judgement will remain essential when things go wrong.

Personally, I find this vision both exciting and slightly worrying: technology will certainly make us more efficient, but we will need to make sure that we don't lose the human interaction that makes our work meaningful.`,

On the night of 12 March, the -80 °C freezer in Lab 3 stopped working. The alarm went off at 2 a.m., but nobody received the notification because the phone number in the system had not been updated after a colleague left the company.

As a result, the temperature rose to -20 °C, and about 150 samples were exposed to unacceptable conditions. When the technician arrived at 7 a.m., the samples were immediately transferred to a backup freezer.

To solve the issue, we replaced the faulty compressor and updated the alarm contact list. In the end, we managed to save around two thirds of the samples, after a quality assessment confirmed that they had not been affected.

This problem can be avoided by checking the alarm system every month. Since then, we have introduced a monthly test of all freezer alarms, and each contact list is now reviewed whenever someone joins or leaves the team.

Looking back, I think we underestimated the importance of the notification system. This experience taught us that the equipment is only as reliable as the procedures around it.`,

    model: `Since the pandemic, remote work has become common in many sectors, and many employees would now like to work from home as often as they wish. However, is total freedom really the best solution?

On the one hand, there is a strong case for flexibility. One of the main advantages is that employees save time and money on commuting, which improves their work-life balance. Moreover, many people find it easier to focus at home, especially on tasks that require a lot of concentration. As a result, they are often more efficient.

On the other hand, the downside is that collaboration and team spirit can suffer. Spontaneous conversations, which often lead to new ideas, rarely happen on video calls. In addition, young employees tend to learn faster when they sit next to experienced colleagues.

That may be true to some extent, but I would argue that these problems can be solved by organising a few days a week in the office. All things considered, I'm inclined to think that a well-organised hybrid model is the most viable option: it gives employees the flexibility they need while preserving the human interaction that makes a team work.`,

Thank you for asking for our opinion on the 4-day workweek.

My overall impression is that it could be very positive for our team. If we adopted a 4-day week, people would probably be more motivated and less tired, and absenteeism might decrease. There's a strong case for it in terms of recruitment, too: it would make us more attractive than our competitors.

However, I'm not entirely convinced that it would work for every department. In production and quality control, some tasks cannot wait, so we would need to organise rotations carefully.

I'd suggest running a six-month pilot in two departments first. This would allow us to measure the impact on productivity before making a final decision.

As you know, the Alpha project is currently three weeks behind schedule. I assume that the main cause is the lack of a detailed timeline: the initial planning must have underestimated the time needed for the validation phase. It might also be related to the fact that two team members left in the spring and were never replaced.

If we had identified these risks earlier, we would probably have avoided most of the delay. However, I believe the situation can still be improved.

First, I would suggest drawing up a new timeline with clear milestones and a person responsible for each task. Second, it might be worth hiring a temporary technician for the next three months. Finally, a short weekly meeting would help everyone stay on the same page.

I would be happy to discuss these ideas with you.

First of all, make sure you are wearing gloves, safety glasses and a lab coat. Before starting, check that the balance has been calibrated that morning.

To begin with, take the samples out of the fridge and let them reach room temperature for about 15 minutes. Next, weigh 50 mg of each sample and transfer it into a labelled tube. Be careful not to mix up the tubes: every label must include the batch number and the date.

Once you have added 5 ml of solvent to each tube, vortex them for 30 seconds. The tubes are then centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 minutes. This ensures that no particles are injected into the column.

After centrifuging the samples, transfer the supernatant into HPLC vials. Finally, record everything in the logbook and place the vials in the autosampler.

If anything unusual happens, don't hesitate to ask a colleague — it is always better to check than to guess.`,

I would like to apologise for the mix-up with your order last week. Instead of the batch you had requested, you received samples from a different study.

The reason is that our new user interface displays two batch numbers on the same screen, and the technician selected the wrong line. In other words, it was a simple human error, but one that the system should have prevented. This was due to a missing verification step, which we had removed when we changed the software in September.

We have already sent you the correct samples by express delivery, and they should arrive tomorrow morning. Please do not use the samples you received; our courier will collect them on Thursday.

To prevent this from happening again, we have reintroduced a double check before every shipment, and the software will now ask for confirmation of the batch number.

I hope this explanation makes sense. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kind regards,
