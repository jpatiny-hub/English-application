    title: 'Northbridge Biologics: from a garage to a global player',
    level: 'B2',
    module: 'company',
    paragraphs: [
      'Northbridge Biologics was founded in 2004 by two former university researchers who had spent years developing a new method for producing enzymes. At the beginning, the company had only three employees and operated from a converted garage near the city centre. Its first product was a diagnostic kit for veterinary clinics.',
      'Since then, the company has grown steadily. Today it employs around 450 people and is organized into five departments: research and development, production, quality control, regulatory affairs and sales. Each department is responsible for its own budget, but there is close collaboration between R&D and production, especially when a new product is being scaled up.',
      'Northbridge now provides services in the pharmaceutical and food sectors, and its clients include hospitals, universities and several large vaccine manufacturers. Although most of its revenue still comes from Europe, the company has a strong presence in North America and opened its first office in Singapore last year.',
      'What sets Northbridge apart, according to its employees, is its culture. Transparency is a priority: every quarter, the management team presents the company\'s results to all staff and answers questions openly. "We work seriously, but we don\'t take ourselves too seriously," says Mira Okafor, who has been working in quality control for eight years. "People are motivated by the impact of what we do, not just by their salary."',
      'This approach seems to pay off. Staff retention is unusually high for the sector, and the company has won several "best employer" awards. The main challenge now, the CEO admits, is to keep this family atmosphere while the company continues to expand.',

    paragraphs: [
      'For years, residents of Barcelona have complained that mass tourism is driving them out of their own neighbourhoods. Rents in the city have risen by almost 70% over the last decade, while wages have barely moved. Young people and families on low incomes have been disproportionately affected.',
      'One of the main causes, according to housing associations, is the explosion of short-term tourist rentals. For many owners, renting a flat to tourists for a few nights is far more lucrative than signing a long-term lease with a local family. As a result, affordable housing has become scarce, and many residents have been evicted when their lease came to an end.',
      'Nadia, a 42-year-old nurse, had lived in the same flat in the city centre for fifteen years when she received an ultimatum from her landlord. "He told me he wouldn\'t renew my contract because he was going to rent the flat to tourists. I didn\'t know where to go. I just wanted to keep a roof over my children\'s heads."',
      'In response, the city council has decided to take a radical step: it will not renew any of the roughly 10,000 licences for tourist flats when they expire. The authorities hope that these homes will return to the long-term rental market. Critics argue that the measure could hurt the local economy and push tourists towards illegal rentals.',
      'Whatever happens, the city is trying to get a grip on a problem that many other European destinations share. Several of them are already considering implementing similar policies.',

      'Since the pandemic, remote and hybrid work have become the norm in many sectors. However, a growing number of companies now want their employees back in the office — and most workers are not happy about it. According to a recent survey, about half of employees say they are upset about coming back to the office full time, and one in four would consider looking for another job.',
      'Employees who prefer remote work give several reasons. The most common is the time saved on commuting: some people used to spend two hours a day in traffic. Others mention a better work-life balance, fewer interruptions and the ability to focus on tasks that require concentration. "Working remotely allows me to be far more efficient, especially when I\'m doing administrative work," explains one respondent.',
      'Employers, on the other hand, argue that the office is essential for collaboration, training and company culture. Many managers are convinced that spontaneous conversations lead to new ideas, and that young employees learn faster when they sit next to experienced colleagues. Some also admit, more quietly, that they find it harder to monitor productivity at a distance.',
      'Between these two positions, hybrid work appears to be the most viable compromise. Nevertheless, the debate is far from over, and it raises a deeper question: is productivity best measured by the hours we spend at our desks, or by what we actually achieve?',

      'In a handful of cities in the United States and China, it is already possible to hail a taxi that has no driver. Fleets of self-driving vehicles now complete hundreds of thousands of trips every week, and their operators are eager to scale globally. There is a lot at stake: analysts assume that the market could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars within a decade.',
      'Supporters claim that robotaxis will represent a step change in road safety. Since most accidents are caused by human error — fatigue, distraction, drivers zoning out — they argue that there will be far fewer accidents once machines take over. Presumably, insurance costs would also fall, and cities could reduce the space devoted to parking.',
      'Critics, however, are not entirely convinced. Several vehicles have blocked emergency services or stopped unexpectedly at the curb, and it is unclear who should be held responsible when an autonomous car causes an accident. Taxi drivers, for their part, fear the disappearance of their jobs, and some cities have been reluctant to issue new permits until these questions have been answered.',
      'The biggest obstacle may not be technical at all. If passengers do not trust the technology, the companies might struggle to generate enough revenue to cover their huge expenses. Chances are that the pace of adoption will depend less on engineers than on public opinion — and on how regulators decide to handle the first serious incidents.',

    paragraphs: [
      'Many modern medicines, from insulin to certain vaccines, are produced by living cells grown in large stainless-steel tanks called bioreactors. Although every product is different, most fermentation runs follow the same basic steps.',
      'First of all, the bioreactor has to be cleaned and sterilized, usually with steam. This step is essential: even a tiny contamination can ruin a batch worth several hundred thousand euros. Once the vessel has cooled down, the culture medium — a carefully balanced mixture of water, sugars, salts and nutrients — is added under sterile conditions.',
      'Next, the bioreactor is inoculated with a small volume of cells that have been grown beforehand in flasks. During the run, which can last from a few days to several weeks, sensors continuously monitor the temperature, pH and oxygen levels. If a parameter drifts, the control system corrects it automatically, but operators must make sure that every alarm is investigated and documented.',
      'When the cells have produced enough of the target molecule, the culture is harvested. The product is then separated from the cells and purified in a series of steps known as downstream processing. Finally, samples are sent to quality control, and the batch can only be released once all the tests have been passed.',
      'Scaling up a process from a 10-litre laboratory bioreactor to a 2,000-litre production tank is one of the most challenging tasks in the industry. What works perfectly on a small scale may behave very differently in a large vessel, which is why many companies spend months optimising each parameter.',
